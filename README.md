# Predicting-house-prices-with-linear-regression
#The Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression project leverages historical housing data to develop a predictive model that estimates house prices based on various property features. By analyzing factors such as location, size, number of rooms, and age of the property, the model aims to provide accurate price predictions for homes in a given area.

Objective: To build a linear regression model that can predict the price of a house based on key features. This tool can assist buyers, sellers, and real estate agents in understanding market trends and making data-driven pricing decisions.

Dataset: The dataset includes features like property size, location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, property age, and other characteristics that influence house prices. It also contains historical pricing data, which is essential for training the predictive model.
